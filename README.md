# Lambda API for English Football teams

## Installation 
```
npm i
``` 

## Start Dev environment to test API
```
npm run dev
```

## Tests 
```
npm run test
```



#What's been done

- serverless API structure with simple temp endpoints
- typescript
- API Gateway type checking (would be better to add some types for request params)
- serverless offline
- eslint
- jest configuration (not fully finished)

#What is left interesting to implement
- autogenerated API Documentation (saw openApi plugin)
- make more strict type checking for responses and arguments
- DB connection (thought about docker-compose for the project to test locally)
- share similar code between lambdas
- build lambdas independently with less possible useless dependencies ()
- try deploy to actual environment
